description: Swift coding style and conventions for the iOS app

### Naming
- Types use PascalCase; variables, funcs use camelCase.
- Prefer clear, full words over abbreviations.

### Formatting
- 4‑space indentation. Match existing style; avoid unrelated reformatting.
- Prefer multi-line for readability over dense one-liners.

### Views and state
- Place SwiftUI views under `Views/<Feature>/<Name>View.swift`.
- Keep views stateless; move IO/business logic into `Services`.
- Use SwiftData for model persistence; avoid singletons except Firebase managers.

### Control flow and errors
- Use guard clauses, handle edge cases first, avoid deep nesting.
- Don’t catch errors without meaningful handling.

### Comments
- Comment the “why”, not the “how”. Keep them concise; avoid trivial comments.
