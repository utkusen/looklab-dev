description: iOS architecture principles for LookLab
---

### Principles
- Keep SwiftUI views declarative and stateless; separate concerns via `Services`.
- Use SwiftData for persistence with models in `Models/`.
- Navigation/state uses SwiftUI + SwiftData; avoid global singletons (Firebase managers allowed).

### Features
- Wardrobe: capture/upload or pick from gallery, typed categories.
- Build a Look: select items + background (elevator, street, restaurant, cafe, plain, beach) → Build.
- My Looks: custom categories; Re-create opens Build with selected items.
- Calendar: 7‑day planner; attach looks; show weather/feels‑like by location.
- Profile: manage face/body photos and sizes; multiple body photos; delete account.
