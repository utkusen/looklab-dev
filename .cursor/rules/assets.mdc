description: Asset organization and naming
---

### Naming
- Images use `img_*`; symbols use `ic_*`. Prefer SF Symbols for icons.
- Sample clothing and face assets live in `Assets.xcassets` with descriptive names.

### Structure
- Clothing images for gallery live under `looklab/looklab/ClothingImages/men|women/...`.
- App asset catalogs live under `looklab/looklab/Assets.xcassets/`.
