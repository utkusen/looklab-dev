### Secrets
- Never commit real `GoogleService-Info.plist` or any credentials/private keys.
- Use environment variables and Firebase configs for secrets. Rotate credentials if leaked.

### Firebase rules
- Validate Firestore and Storage rules using emulators before deploy.
- Limit public access to Storage; prefer signed URLs over `makePublic()` where feasible.

### Data deletion
- Provide callable to delete all user data (Firestore docs, Storage files).
